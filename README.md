[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ramp-kits/sea_ice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ramp-kits/sea_ice)

Go to [`ramp-worflow`](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow) for more help on the [RAMP](http:www.ramp.studio) ecosystem.

Install ramp-workflow (rampwf), then execute

```
ramp_test_submission
```

to test the starting kit submission (`submissions/starting_kit`) and

```
ramp_test_submission --submission whole_fields
```

to test `whole_fields` or any other submission in `submissions`.

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](sea_ice_starting_kit.ipynb).
